# Mortar

# What does it stand for ?

Mortar is a project for "Democratic Inputs to AI" by OpenAI. The metaphor of mortar being the cement that holds bricks together to create a strong foundation can be applied to the idea of democratic inputs being the building blocks of a strong and fair democratic process.

# What is the goal of the project

The project answers to the "Democratic Input to AI" program launched by the nonprofit organization OpenAI. The "Mortar" application aims to provide users a democratic process. As OpenAI organizers wrote :

> By “democratic process”, we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions, and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.



# Backbone of the project

I don't have extensive ressources for this project and I aim to use new technologies to help me build the project at a cheaper cost. For example, I restrained my database usage to storage of pools answers and decided to use a blockchain authentification process.

Since in a democracy everyone has the same vote power, Mortar has to identifiy every individual and only allow one voting power thus KYC is mandatory, and some of blockchain players have built technologies to adress this issue.

Moreover, Mortar will be for mobile users first. This implies that the interface is user friendly. I made loads of research to make it clear and simple to interact with Mortar. The purpose is clear "Collect democratic inputs to AI".


# About the author

I, H. DEMENEZ, decided to bring my own ideas to the table through the "Mortar" project. This is an application to the contest and also a way to suggest innovation for better usability of Artificial Intelligence, Generative Pre-trained Transformer model broadly.

I am still a student at Institut Supérieur d'Electronique et du Numérique of Lille, and expect to graduate with an Engineering degree in September 2023, after 5 years of studies around Computer Science, Corporate Finance alongside a master of Quantitative Finance at University of Lille.

I am building this project on my own as an individual, not as a moral entity. I choose to start building on my own but feel free to contribute by making pull requests to the git repository.
